# HTML & CSS Validation

HTML and CSS validation is the process of checking your web code to ensure it follows the established web standards set by organizations like the W3C. Validation helps identify syntax errors and mismatches in your code. This is important because it ensures cross-browser compatibility, improves website accessibility, and enhances search engine optimization. Additionally, using validators can help maintain a consistent and professional appearance of your website across different platforms and devices.
