A favicon, or "favorite icon," is a small, 16x16 pixel icon associated with a specific webpage or website, typically displayed in the browser's address bar, tab, or bookmark menu. It serves as a visual identifier for users, enhancing brand recognition and improving the overall user experience. By including a favicon, web developers can ensure their website appears professional and easily identifiable among multiple open tabs or saved bookmarks. The favicon is implemented through an HTML `<link>` tag within the website's `<head>` section, linking to an image file that is often saved in .ico, .png, or .jpg format.

#### Code sample to include a favicon

```html
<head>
  <link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="favicon.png">
</head>
```

Don't forget to include the graphic along with your files.
