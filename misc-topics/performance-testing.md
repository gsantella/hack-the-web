# Performance Testing

Performance testing and Lighthouse testing are crucial components in assessing a website's overall efficiency and user experience. Performance testing involves evaluating the speed, scalability, and stability of a web application under various conditions, ensuring that it meets the desired criteria for performance.&#x20;

Lighthouse is an open-source, automated tool used to enhance the quality of web pages. It provides detailed reports on elements such as performance, accessibility, SEO, and more. By running a Lighthouse test, developers can identify critical issues impacting site speed and usability, receive actionable insights, and improve their website to achieve optimal performance outcomes.
