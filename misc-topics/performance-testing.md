# Performance Testing

Lighthouse testing is a crucial component in assessing a website's overall efficiency, performance, and user experience. Performance testing involves evaluating the speed, scalability, and stability of a web application under various conditions, ensuring that it meets the desired criteria for performance.&#x20;

Lighthouse is an open-source, automated tool used to enhance the quality of web pages. It provides detailed reports on elements such as performance, accessibility, SEO, and more. By running a Lighthouse test, developers can identify critical issues impacting site speed and usability, receive actionable insights, and improve their website to achieve optimal performance outcomes.
