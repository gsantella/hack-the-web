# Search Engine Optimization

### Why

Everyone wants their webpage to rank higher on search results. Now you can choose to pay for this or you can create your pages in a way.

### SEO Techniques

Sometimes it is as simple as adding a **Google Business Listing** ([https://www.google.com/business/](https://www.google.com/business/)) so that Google knows more about your organization and website, but there are many other techniques that help get your site more noticed and ranked higher by search engines.

### Basic SEO Practices for a Web Page

1. **Keyword Research**: Identify relevant keywords that your audience is searching for and integrate them naturally throughout your content.
2. **Title Tag Optimization**: Ensure each page has a unique and descriptive title tag that includes your primary keyword. Aim for 50-60 characters.
3. **Meta Description**: Write compelling meta descriptions of 150-160 characters that accurately summarize your page content and include a call-to-action.
4. **Header Tags**: Use proper header tags (H1, H2, H3) to structure your content for both readability and SEO, ensuring primary keywords are included.
5. **Image Optimization**: Use descriptive filenames and alt tags for images to improve accessibility and SEO.
6. **Internal Linking**: Build internal links between pages to help with site navigation and distribute page authority across your site.
7. **Mobile-Friendliness**: Ensure your website is responsive and performs well on all devices, as mobile-friendliness is a ranking factor.
8. **Page Speed**: Optimize page loading speed by compressing images, leveraging browser caching, and minimizing CSS and JavaScript files.
9. **High-Quality Content**: Create informative, engaging, and original content that answers the needs of your audience and encourages sharing.
10. **URL Structure**: Use clean, descriptive URLs that include relevant keywords and are easy to understand.
