**Markdown** is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed to be easy-to-read and easy-to-write, using an intuitive syntax that converts into HTML for web displays.&#x20;

**Markdown** allows writers to create formatted documents using simple text editors without needing to delve into intricate HTML coding. Basic elements like headings, lists, links, and emphasis are represented by simple symbols, such as asterisks for emphasis or hashtags for headings, making it efficient for writers to format content consistently across various platforms.

**Markdown** simply converts to HTML underneath allowing you to quickly write code in web applications like Discord.
