# ðŸ’¼ Career Paths in Web Design

Many of our [SouthHills](https://www.southhills.edu/) students and graduates find themselves working with web design at their internships and first jobs. They might be doing things like:

* adding data to an **IT ticketing system** as they solve problems at the **technology help desk**
* keeping a website updated using the WordPress CMS
* some of the IT students would be working more with DNS and hosting issues with websites, while the software developers would spend more time with the code that makes up the web pages and web applications.
