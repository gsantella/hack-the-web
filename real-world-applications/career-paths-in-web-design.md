# ðŸ’¼ Career Paths in Web Design

Many of our [SouthHills](https://www.southhills.edu/) students and graduates find themselves working with web design at their internships and first jobs. They might be doing things like:

* fixing a broken link on a webpage and updating an **IT ticketing system** as they solve problems at the **technology help desk**
* keeping a website updated using the **WordPress CMS**
* some of the IT students would be working more with DNS, servers, and hosting websites in the cloud
* The software development students would spend more time with the code that makes up the **web pages** as they build out **web applications** to help organize the data for business applications.
