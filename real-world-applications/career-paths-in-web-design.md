# ðŸ’¼ Career Paths in Web Design

Many of our [SouthHills](https://www.southhills.edu/) students and graduates find themselves working with web design at their internships and first jobs. They might be doing things like:

* fixing a broken link on a webpage and updating an **IT ticketing system** as they solve problems at the **technology help desk**
* keeping a website updated using the **WordPress CMS**
* some of the IT students would be working more DNS and hosting websites in the cloud, while the software developers would spend more time with the code that makes up the **web pages** and **web applications**
