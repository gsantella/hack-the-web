# Putting it all together

{% hint style="info" %}
**HTML is** for structuring web content, **CSS** for styling and layout, and **JavaScript** to add interactivity and dynamic elements.&#x20;

Because the web is everywhere in business, all of our IT and Software Development students at [SouthHills](https://www.southhills.edu/) take multiple classes where web design is covered.
