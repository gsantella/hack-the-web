# Image Formats

### **Image Formats Commonly Used**

**JPG (JPEG)**: A commonly used format with lossy compression, ideal for photographs and images with gradients, but may lose quality during editing due to compression.

**HEIC**: A format used by Apple, employing advanced compression, providing better image quality and smaller file sizes compared to JPG. Not universally supported across all platforms.

**PNG**: Supports lossless compression with transparency features, making it excellent for graphics and images requiring sharp edges, but usually results in larger file sizes.

**WEBP**: Designed by Google, it offers both lossy and lossless compression with smaller file sizes for web use, but may not be compatible with all browsers and tools.

**SVG**: A vector format ideal for logos and icons that require scaling without losing quality. Useful for illustrations, not suitable for complex images like photographs.
