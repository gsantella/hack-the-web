### Color Theory

Color theory is a framework that guides the use of color in art and design. It consists of principles and guidelines that help artists and designers effectively mix, match, and apply colors to create visually appealing compositions. Some key concepts include:

* **Primary Colors**: The foundational colors (red, blue, yellow) that cannot be created by mixing other colors.
* **Secondary Colors**: Colors formed by mixing two primary colors (green, orange, purple).
* **Complementary Colors**: Colors located directly opposite each other on the color wheel, offering high contrast and vibrant visuals when paired.
* **Warm Colors**: Colors like red, orange, and yellow that evoke warmth and energy.
* **Cool Colors**: Colors such as blue, green, and purple that create a calming and soothing effect.

Understanding these concepts helps in creating balanced designs that appear to go together naturally.

### Understanding RGB and CMYK

**RGB (Red, Green, Blue):**\
The RGB color model is used mainly for digital screens. It combines red, green, and blue light in various ways to produce a broad spectrum of colors. Colors are represented as combinations of these three primary colors, commonly in the format `rgb(red, green, blue)`.

**CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black):**\
CMYK is a subtractive color model used in color printing. It uses the colors cyan, magenta, yellow, and black to produce a wide range of colors on physical media. Each color value is a percentage that adjusts the level of each ink during the printing process.

#### Using RGB in CSS

In CSS, you can apply colors using the RGB color model with the `rgb()` function. Here's an example:

```css
.element {
  background-color: rgb(255, 0, 0); /* Pure red */
}

.text {
  color: rgb(0, 128, 0); /* Dark green */
}
```

CSS also allows an RGBA format, adding an alpha channel for transparency:

```css
.overlay {
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.5); /* Semi-transparent blue */
}
```

### For overall design, some designers would say:

* Pick a set of colors
* Pick a layout
* Pick some Fonts that go together&#x20;
* And you'll have a unique design
