#### Color Theory

Color theory is a framework that guides the use of color in art and design. It consists of principles and guidelines that help artists and designers effectively mix, match, and apply colors to create visually appealing compositions. Some key concepts include:

* **Primary Colors**: The foundational colors (red, blue, yellow) that cannot be created by mixing other colors.
* **Secondary Colors**: Colors formed by mixing two primary colors (green, orange, purple).
* **Complementary Colors**: Colors located directly opposite each other on the color wheel, offering high contrast and vibrant visuals when paired.
* **Warm Colors**: Colors like red, orange, and yellow that evoke warmth and energy.
* **Cool Colors**: Colors such as blue, green, and purple that create a calming and soothing effect.

Understanding these concepts helps in creating balanced designs that appear to go together naturally.
