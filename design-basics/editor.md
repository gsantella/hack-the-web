#### Typography and Fonts on Web Pages

Typography in web design involves the strategic use of fonts to enhance readability, accessibility, and aesthetics. Here are key considerations:

* **Font Choice:** Choose web-safe fonts or use Google Fonts to ensure consistency across devices and browsers.
* **Font Size and Line Height:** Maintain a legible font size and appropriate line height to ensure comfortable reading.
* **Contrast:** Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background for readability.
* **Hierarchy:** Use different font weights and sizes to establish a clear hierarchy and guide the readerâ€™s eye.
* **Responsive Design:** Ensure your typography adjusts well on different screen sizes to maintain readability.

Remember, effective typography enhances user experience and communicates the brand's voice effectively.

### Using a Google Font

&#x20;

To utilize a Google Font in your web design, include the following link in the `<head>` section of your HTML file:

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

Then, apply the font in your CSS:

```css
body {
    font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
}
```
