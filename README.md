# Welcome to Hack the Web

Welcome to our South Hills School of Business & Technology mini-course on Hacking the Web! Here you'll get an overview of the newest features of web design, help you get started building and designing interactive websites, and learn how people craft the world wide web that we use every day.

You'll see some of the best parts and coding in action and start building your own websites and exploring frontend development. Thank you for checking this out and being here - it shows you are a _**hacker**_, a _**builder**_, and _**maker**_, so lets create the web, not just be a consumer of it!
