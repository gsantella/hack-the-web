# Hosting Sites

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/jYpL9xMUEFI" %}

To host a website, you need at least one server connected to the internet where your site's files reside. This can be done through various services like DigitalOcean App Platform, which provides cloud hosting solutions. \
\
When someone enters your domain name, the Domain Name System (DNS) translates it into an IP address, directing them to your server. \
\
Platforms like GitHub offer version control for site files, while CloudFlare can enhance site security and performance by acting as a content delivery network (CDN).
