## Backend vs Frontend Web Languages

**Frontend Languages:**

* Focus on the client side, what users interact with directly in the web browser.
* This code runs on the browser after it has been downloaded from the server.
* Key languages include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* Responsible for the structure, design, and behavior of web pages.
* Examples: React, Angular, Vue.js.

**Backend Languages and Tools:**

* Manage server-side operations, database interactions, and application logic.
* This code runs on the server before it is sent to the browser on the client machine.
* Common languages include Python, Java, Ruby, PHP, and Node.js.
* Handle data storage, authentication, and server communication.
* Examples: Django, Spring, Laravel, Ruby on Rails, Express, and Flask

Frontend deals with user interface and experience, while backend manages data processing and business logic.
